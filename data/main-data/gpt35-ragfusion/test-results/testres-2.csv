This will bring you into direct contact with the most sophisticated contemporary neural network-based NLP technologies (think Transformers, BERT, ALBERT, etc.) as we grow, while keeping you grounded in a tech stack that will remain relevant as various waves of AI hype come and go.
You will be joining a strong team with domain experts ready to teach you anything you dont already know. An exact match on skills is less critical than strong design instincts, high quality coding discipline and enthusiasm for taking on an ambitious project that will reshape the way people interact with enterprise software.

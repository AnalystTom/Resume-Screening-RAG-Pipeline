# Introduction

A solution to provide a more transparent, intuitive, and efficient working tool to hiring managers in resume matching and analysis among thousands of resumes is necessary. In response to this, the overall goal of the paper is to propose an LLM-based assistant aiming to aid hiring managers in screening resumes more efficiently through the form of question-answering. For a high-level description, the key design is to integrate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to effectively retrieve the top matching resumes from a large pool of applicants and augment them to the LLM's knowledge base, which enables the generation of high-level, accurate, and relevant responses about the applicants to the recruiter's queries. Through this proposed system, the expected outcome of the paper is being able to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of a proof of concept which contributes a potential solution to resume matching and analysis for hiring managers in the screening process.
